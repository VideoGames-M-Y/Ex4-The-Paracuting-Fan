# Ex4-The-Paracuting-Fan

In this game, you control a parachutist descending from the sky and use a fan to guide them toward a target landing platform. The player must adjust the fan's position and rotation to ensure the parachutist lands safely, navigating through obstacles and maintaining proper control over the descent.

## Key Features:
* Physics-based gameplay: The fan's wind force directly influences the parachutist's movement.
* Fan Control: The player can manually position and rotate the fan to steer the parachutist.
* Level progression: Complete each level by successfully landing the parachutist on the platform.
* Dynamic difficulty: As the game progresses, the fan mechanics and the challenges increase in complexity.
